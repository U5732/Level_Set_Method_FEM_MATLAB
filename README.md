# Level Set Methods for Two-Phase Flows with FEM

Numerical Analysis of Level Set Methods for Two-Phase Flows with FEM in MATLAB for my Master Thesis in Computational Science at Uppsala University.

Please note that it was implemented in 2014 with the help of the following book:

- The Finite Element Method: Theory, Implementation, and Applications by Mats G. Larson and Fredrik Bengzon (http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-642-33287-6)

My report can be found in the following link:

And the presentation (in pdf) for the report can be found in the repository.
